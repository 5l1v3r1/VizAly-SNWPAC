# VizAly-LossyWave: A lossy, wavelet-based compressor for scientific simulation data

LossyWave is a cubic B-Spline wavelet compressor for regular grid datasets (1D,2D,3D). The goal for this method is to provide a low cost, low overhead compression method for smart data reduction via a series of parameters achieving targetted levels of lossyness.
